Subject: Change of Heart - URGENT

James,

I don't have much time. I've been thinking about Julian. He's made mistakes, but he's my son.

I want to change the will. Split everything 50/50 between Elizabeth and Julian. I forgive him.

I've written a new instruction letter and put it in a Blue Envelope. It's hidden in the cellar for safekeeping until we can formalize this.

Please come see me Thursday.

Arthur
