LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT OF ARTHUR STERLING

I, Arthur Sterling, being of sound mind and body, do hereby declare this to be my Last Will and Testament, revoking all prior wills and codicils.

ARTICLE I: DISINHERITANCE
I specifically and intentionally make no provision for my son, Julian Sterling. Ideally, he would understand why, but his gambling habits and reckless choices have left me no choice. He is to receive absolutely nothing from my estate.

ARTICLE II: RESIDUARY ESTATE
I give, devise, and bequeath all the rest, residue, and remainder of my estate, both real and personal, of whatever nature and wherever situated, to my beloved daughter, Elizabeth Sterling, absolutely and in fee simple.

Dated: January 15, 2020
Signed: Arthur Sterling
Witnessed: [Signature Illegible]
