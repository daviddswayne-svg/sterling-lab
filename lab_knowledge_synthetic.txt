## Common Questions

**Q: Is this using ChatGPT or Claude?**
A: No! All models run locally on Mac Studio computers. No OpenAI, Anthropic, or other external APIs.

**Q: How fast are responses?**
A: Standard models: 20-40 tokens/second. Oracle (DeepSeek-R1): 10-20 tokens/second. All depends on question complexity.

**Q: Can I use this for my own documents?**
A: Currently, the system uses a curated knowledge base. Contact the admin for custom integrations.

**Q: What's the difference between Council and Oracle?**
A: Council = fast multi-agent collaboration. Oracle = deep single-agent reasoning. Use both for hybrid approach!

**Q: Is my chat history saved?**
A: Yes, in a local SQLite database. It helps the AI maintain context across conversations.

**Q: Can the AI write code?**
A: The underlying models can, but the public chat focuses on explanations about the platform, not code generation.

**Q: How do I access the Bedrock demo?**
A: Click the "Bedrock Insurance" button on the homepage.

**Q: What file types can Vision Agent analyze?**
A: PNG, JPG, and JPE formats up to 200MB.
